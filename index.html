        <p>I am a theoretical physicist and dedicated PhD student with a focus on Particle Physics. With my curiosity and passion for science, I am currently pursuing my doctorate at King's College London. Before joining King's for my doctorate, I have graduated with a Bachelor and Master of Science with distinction from RWTH Aachen University. My academic journey has also taken me to UC Berkeley, where I spent part of my Master's.</p>

         <p>My research is focused on some of the outstanding puzzles in Particle Physics: While the jury is still out on some anomalies measured in disagreement with predictions from the well-tested Standard Model of Particle Physics, other major problems remain. Among the latter I am particularly interested in elucidating the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and addressing the Electroweak Hierarchy Problem.</p>
            
        <p>Throughout my academic career, I have consistently demonstrated commitment to … . My professional values are grounded in … .these principles not only guide my research but also define my approach to problem-solving and innovation in the field of theoretical high-energy physics. As I continue to advance in the realm of theoretical physics, I invite you to <a href="research.html">explore my work</a>, join me in the pursuit of knowledge and scientific advancement, and <a href="contact.html">reach out to me</a> with any enquiry.</p>
